## Conversation Context Summary

**Overall Goal:** To make the React frontend (`Home.tsx`) fully dynamic, allowing content and its layout/styling to be controlled from the WordPress backend via custom CSS classes, while maintaining the visual design of the original demo page.

---

### **What Has Been Done (and generally worked):**

1.  **Dynamic Content Extraction:**
    *   Implemented a `dynamicContentBlocks` state in `Home.tsx` to store parsed content from WordPress.
    *   The `useEffect` hook now fetches WordPress page content and uses `doc.querySelectorAll('.wp-content-block')` to extract elements.
    *   Each extracted block is categorized by its specific identifying class (e.g., `hero-main-title`, `hero-subtitle-block`, `cta-button`, `info-card-block`).

2.  **Dynamic Rendering of Repeatable Blocks:**
    *   **CTA Buttons:** Successfully made dynamic. Multiple buttons with the `wp-content-block` and `cta-button` classes (and `is-style-outline` for secondary styling) now render correctly, with each instance appearing as a distinct button.
    *   **Hero Subtitle Block (`hero-subtitle-block`):** The entire block (including its inner content) is extracted as `rawHtml` and rendered using `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`. This allows for multiple instances of this block to be rendered.
    *   **Hero Description Block (`hero-description-block`):** Similar to the subtitle block, this entire block is extracted as `rawHtml` and rendered dynamically.
    *   **Quick Info Cards (`info-card-block`):** The entire card structure is now dynamically rendered for each `info-card-block` found in WordPress, correctly populating headings and text within each card.

3.  **"Kind-of-Dynamic" Sizing (Height & Width Estimation):**
    *   For `hero-description-block`, a heuristic-based approach was implemented to estimate `dynamicHeight` and `dynamicWidth` based on content length.
    *   The `dynamicWidth` is capped at `40rem` to prevent excessive width.
    *   This provides a balance between fixed design and content adaptability.

### **What Did NOT Lead to Desired Results / Current Issues:**

1.  **Styling of Dynamic Blocks:**
    *   Initial attempts to simply change `h-XX` to `h-auto` for dynamic sizing resulted in the loss of the geometric visual design of the containers.
    *   The subsequent use of `min-h-XX` and `min-w-XX` was a better approach but still didn't fully satisfy the visual requirements for all elements.
    *   The current "kind-of-dynamic" sizing for `hero-description-block` is a compromise, but the user wants to apply this to `hero-subtitle-block` as well.

2.  **Order of Rendered Elements:**
    *   **Primary Issue:** The elements are currently rendered grouped by their `type` (e.g., all `hero-subtitle-block`s, then all `hero-description-block`s, then all `cta-button`s), rather than in the exact order they appear in the WordPress editor.
    *   **Root Cause:** The main "Geometric Hero Content" section in `Home.tsx` still has a static `hero-main-title` block, and then separate `filterContent().map()` calls for other block types. This breaks the order.
    *   **Proposed Solution (Attempted but failed `replace`):** The plan is to integrate *all* main content blocks (including `hero-main-title`) into a single `dynamicContentBlocks.map()` loop with a `switch` statement to preserve the order. The last `replace` operation to integrate `hero-main-title` into this loop failed due to `old_string` mismatch.

---

### **Next Steps:**

The immediate next step is to successfully implement the refactoring to render *all* main content blocks within the "Geometric Hero Content" section dynamically within a single `dynamicContentBlocks.map` loop, ensuring the order from WordPress is maintained. This requires correctly integrating `hero-main-title` into that loop.

After that, we can revisit applying the "kind-of-dynamic" sizing to the `hero-subtitle-block` and any other elements as needed.
